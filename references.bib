  abstract = {The fall rate of nearly 600 lodgepole pines(Pinus contorta)killed by the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in central Oregon was investigated in thinned and unthinned stands. Estimates were obtained by fitting a complementary log-log model to the conditional probabilities of trees falling within a given year. Snags began falling 3 yr after death in thinned stands and 5 yr in unthinned stands. Small trees fell slightly faster than large trees in thinned stands, but tree size was not a factor in the fall rate in unthinned stands. In thinned stands, 50\% were down in 8 yr and 90\% were down in 12 yr. In unthinned stands, 50\% were down in 9 yr and 90\% were down in 14 yr. No particular calendar year had tree fall that was significantly greater than average. All beetle-killed trees broke off at the ground when they fell. The rate that trees fall in different environments may be related to the speed of bole decay at the ground level. West. J. Appl. For. 13(1):23-26.},

  abstract = {In Colorado and southern Wyoming, mountain pine beetle (MPB) has affected over 1.6 million ha of predominantly lodgepole pine forests, raising concerns about effects of MPB-caused mortality on subsequent wildfire risk and behavior. Using empirical data we modeled potential fire behavior across a gradient of wind speeds and moisture scenarios in Green stands compared three stages since MPB attack (Red [1\textendash 3 yrs], Grey [4\textendash 10 yrs], and Old-MPB [{$\sim$}30 yrs]). MPB killed 50\% of the trees and 70\% of the basal area in Red and Grey stages. Across moisture scenarios, canopy fuel moisture was one-third lower in Red and Grey stages compared to the Green stage, making active crown fire possible at lower wind speeds and less extreme moisture conditions. More-open canopies and high loads of large surface fuels due to treefall in Grey and Old-MPB stages significantly increased surface fireline intensities, facilitating active crown fire at lower wind speeds ({$>$}30\textendash 55 km/hr) across all moisture scenarios. Not accounting for low foliar moistures in Red and Grey stages, and large surface fuels in Grey and Old-MPB stages, underestimates the occurrence of active crown fire. Under extreme burning conditions, minimum wind speeds for active crown fire were 25\textendash 35 km/hr lower for Red, Grey and Old-MPB stands compared to Green. However, if transition to crown fire occurs (outside the stand, or within the stand via ladder fuels or wind gusts {$>$}65 km/hr), active crown fire would be sustained at similar wind speeds, suggesting observed fire behavior may not be qualitatively different among MPB stages under extreme burning conditions. Overall, the risk (probability) of active crown fire appears elevated in MPB-affected stands, but the predominant fire hazard (crown fire) is similar across MPB stages and is characteristic of lodgepole pine forests where extremely dry, gusty weather conditions are key factors in determining fire behavior.},
