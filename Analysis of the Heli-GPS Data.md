# Analysis of the Heli-GPS Data

## Introduction and Data
Most trees will have lost all needles, classifying as grey-attack, three years after they have been attacked by the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB). When measuring LiDAR data at the end of March, al green-attack trees that have been attacked in 2019 and before, as well as all red-attack trees detected in 2020 and before, will now classify as grey attack. Of those treees that have been detected as re-attack in 2021, some will still classify as red-attack and others as grey-attack. This is due to the fact that the heli-GPS data provided by the government of Alberta cannot distinguish between different years of red-attack.

The roads are downloaded from several pages that I will have to cite here.
